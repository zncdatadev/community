## Contributing

If you have one or more Signatures you'd like to share, please make a pull
request and we'll take care of it eventually.

Before submitting your request make sure that:

- You take a look at the community guidelines
- Your code is working.
- Your code is unique: don't reinvent the wheel and check whether someone already provided a similar solution.
- Your code is relevant to the project and actually adds some value.
- Your code is placed in the correct directory.

There are many factors that make it easier for us to merge your pull request.
Inclusion of `sample hashes`, before and after results, and tested
environment(s) really help us with evaluating your potential contributions,
and as such make the merge it more quickly.

We take the discretion to approve or reject submissions at our will.
